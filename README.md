## Plant Seedling Classification
Image classification using CNNs in Keras

### Context
Can we differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment. The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages

### Objective
Using the techniquies learned during the Computer Vision course, build a model to correctly classify the images from the dataset into 12 classes
